### Algorithm

1. AI Moderation
   - Message Analysis:
     - Evaluates message content and up to 15 messages of context
     - Considers user roles, permissions, and interaction history
     - Checks channel type and permission settings
   - Severity Scoring (0-10):
     - 0-2: Normal discussion, constructive criticism, casual conversation
     - 3-4: Mild hostility, borderline content, heated but non-personal arguments
     - 5-7: Direct hostility, targeted behavior, inappropriate content
     - 8: Triggers warning, logs violation, notifies user
     - 9-10: Automatic timeout with multipliers (2x for 9, 3x for 10)
   - Permission Restrictions on Violations:
     - Message sending (regular and thread)
     - File attachments and reactions
     - Channel/thread management
     - Mention privileges
     - Forum post creation
   - System Constraints:
     - Excludes bot messages
     - 24-hour message age limit
     - Exempts thread owners and managers
     - Prevents duplicate checks

2. Featured Posts
   - Threshold:
     - Calculates average post message count
     - Reduces threshold 50% if activity < 50 msgs for 7 days
     - Maintains 10 message minimum
     - Weekly threshold updates
   - Rotation:
     - High activity (>100 msgs/day): 12h rotation
     - Low activity (<10 msgs/day): 48h rotation
     - Normal activity: 24h rotation
   - Criteria:
     - Message count vs threshold
     - Activity within rotation window
     - Post status (not archived/locked)

3. Timeout
   - Base Duration:
     - Initial: 300 seconds
     - Multiplier: 1.2-2.0x
   - Adjustments:
     - Activity-based: Â±20%
     - Violation rate: +50%/-25% multiplier
     - AI severity: 2-3x multiplier
     - Progressive penalties with 24-48h decay
     - Global triggers after 3+ violations
     - Hard cap at 1 hour

4. Rate Limiting
   - Per-User Limits:
     - 10 requests/minute
     - 2000 tokens/minute
     - 5-minute breach cooldown
     - 1-hour cache expiry
   - Global Constraints:
     - 30 requests/minute
     - 7000 tokens/minute
     - Daily: 7000 requests, 500000 tokens
   - Resource Distribution:
     - 70% user checks
     - 20% auto-moderation
     - 10% maintenance
   - Model Hierarchy:
     - Primary: `llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview`
     - Secondary: `llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview`
     - Fallback: `llama-3.1-70b-versatile`
